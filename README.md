# Formcraft

### Problem Statement:
Most people ignore surveys because there's no real incentive. I’m fixing that by making surveys rewarding — you get tokens or NFTs every time you respond. It’s all built on the Sui blockchain so everything’s transparent, secure, and actually fun.

### Solution:
We built a platform where anyone can create surveys on-chain using Sui. When someone responds, their answers are stored securely on the blockchain, and they are rewarded for it to keep them incentivized.
